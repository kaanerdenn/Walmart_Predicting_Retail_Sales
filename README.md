# Walmart_Predicting_Retail_Sales

This project involves the analysis of retail sales data and the development of regression models to predict weekly sales based on various features. The dataset consists of historical sales data for multiple stores and departments, and it aims to understand the factors that affect weekly sales.

## Data Exploration

The project begins with data exploration and visualization to gain insights into the dataset. Some of the key steps include:

- Checking the general overview of the dataset, including its shape and data types.
- Visualizing the distribution of store types and departments.
- Exploring the impact of holidays on sales.
- Analyzing sales trends over different years and weeks.
- Examining the average sales per department and store.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for regression modeling. Some of the preprocessing steps include:

- Merging datasets: Combining sales data with additional store-related information.
- Handling missing values: Removing or imputing missing data.
- Feature selection: Identifying relevant features and dropping irrelevant ones.
- Correlation analysis: Identifying and removing variables with weak correlations.

## Regression Modeling

The project involves building regression models to predict weekly sales based on selected features. Three regression models are explored:

1. Ridge Regression: GridSearchCV is used to find the optimal alpha value.
2. Lasso Regression: GridSearchCV is used to determine the best alpha value.
3. Decision Tree Regression: The depth of the decision tree is optimized using GridSearchCV.
4. Random Forest Regression: RandomizedSearchCV is employed to fine-tune hyperparameters.

The performance of each regression model is evaluated using metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and R-squared.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn`.

2. Execute the Python script to perform data analysis and regression modeling. Ensure that the necessary dataset files are available or specify the URLs to download them.

3. Review the model performance metrics, including RMSE and R-squared, to assess the quality of regression models.

4. Use the trained regression models to make predictions for future sales or analyze the impact of different features on weekly sales.

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on retail sales data and regression modeling concepts and serves as a practical example of data analysis and machine learning in the retail domain.
